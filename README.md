# javashare
creating a repository to share with java community, blogs, articles

1) You will need to have JDK installed in your machine before you can run the program. I have checked it with both Java 7 and 8 but it should work with as early as Java 5.

2) Download Google Guava library before you compile the code - http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/google/guava/guava/18.0/guava-18.0.jar

A little older or later version wont' harm.

3) Make sure you have set your path, java_home and classpath. I use .bash_profile in my mac or ubuntu while the environment variables in windows.

4) To compile the command is: javac -d . *.java

5) To run the command is: java com.java.share.collection.FixedMapRunner

For any issue with the program, please email me at ashikuzzaman@gmail.com
